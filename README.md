mailbox practice in system verilog

In SystemVerilog, a mailbox is a communication mechanism used to transfer data between processes or components, such as between a driver and a monitor or a generator and a driver, in a testbench environment (especially in UVM or other verification methodologies).
What is a Mailbox?
A mailbox is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue that can be used for synchronization and data exchange between parallel threads or classes. Think of it like a message queue.
